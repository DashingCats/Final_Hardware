# Final_Hardware

## Thought Process
How this design came together was that i wanted to make a design based around the ghosts shape, and is able to comfortably be able to fit onto a users lap so the users are comfortable.

## How It Can Be Improved
It can be approved by making the controller more ergonmic, creating a better layout of the buttons/led, and a adjustments to make the controller resemble more of a ghosts, and a few other minor adjustments. I would also add for a way the controller shell can be opened/closed such as a hinge or screws.
